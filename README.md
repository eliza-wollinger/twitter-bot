To make life easier for all hackathon lovers, I developed a bot that will retweet everything related to these events. 👩‍💻

### How to run the Bot? 🏃‍♀️

Due to security concerns, the bot's private keys cannot be in the code, so to work, you need to replace in the **key.py** the variables ``consumer_key``, ``consumer_secret``, ``access_token`` and ``access_token_secret``.

You can use these commands in the terminal to run the bot:

On Windows:
```sh
py -3 main.py
```

On other systems:
```sh
python3 main.py
```
